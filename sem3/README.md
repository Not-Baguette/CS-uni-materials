| Status | Code | Course | Credits (SKS) | Minimum Passing Grade (KKM) | Description | Prerequisite
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| Compulsory (Wajib) | IF350 | [Software Engineering and Project Management](#) | 3 SKS (5.04 ECTS) | 55 (C) | This course student will apply the principles and approaches of software engineering theory and practice and manage them into a software project management that is efficient, within budget, quickly and of good quality. Student will develop a comprehensive project plan using the project of their choice. By the end of this course, student will understand why project management requires a high level of professionalism, and how to achieve that goal in future software projects | N/A
| Compulsory (Wajib) | [IF330](#) | [Web Programming](#) | 3 SKS (5.04 ECTS) | 55 (C) | This course covers web programming using server side scripting (eg. PHP) and database. | [IF231 Introduction to internet technology](https://github.com/Not-Baguette/CS-uni-materials/blob/main/sem2/README.md#introduction-to-internet-technology---if231)
| Compulsory (Wajib) | IF331 | Declarative programming |  | 55 (C) | Declarative programming is a programming paradigm in which a computer program is formed based on a computational logic structure that can be used to solve a problem. In declarative programming, the source code of a program does not express the control flow of a problem solving. The purpose of using declarative programming is to minimize and eliminate side effects (in the form of bugs) from a program by describing what must be solved based on a problem domain. By understanding declarative programming, besides being able to create programs that are free from side effects, users can also write parallel programs more easily. Logical programming and functional programming are two parts of the declarative programming paradigm. This course will specifically discuss logic programming as part of declarative programming |
